  <p style="color:white;">This is the final assignment's reflection. In this course i learnt
    a lot of stuff such as making my own web page, styling it and also writing multiple functions for a specific reason, such as creating a button. 
  However, the most important thing that i learnt was creating a web page. As we were asked in the final assignment of this course, i created a web page for online watches.
  Where a user can buy a watch online. As for the, HTML Form that i created, it was actually a but challenging but on the other hand i also had some fun creating it.
  What i mean by that is, i had the help of youtube videos that our professors suggested us in order to create the HTML Forms. Surely i had some errors however, not that many
because, i followed every step that my professors told me to take, the videos helped out a lot. Although, i was able to complete the form this doesn't mean i didn't have any errors, i did have some errors
as i mentioned before but, i was able to detect them, how so? After every step i took i tested it out so that i was able to locate the error much quicker rather than detecting errors after i have written a bunch of code. 
To create the HTML Form i took the following steps, i first created an html file, latter on i moved on creating an account on  https://formspree.io/, after that i moved on to creating and styling my contact.html file, so that it included all the requirements.  
The requirements were for exmaple: Name, email, address, and most importantly feedback box, were the user could either ask a question or just give some feedback or report a problem.
My advise for other developers that would like to build their own forms for their own web pages would be, just practice and try to get help from Youtube videos, which in my opinion really helped me out.
And also ask as many questions you can from your professors, or other programming peers you got around you. Building in a group is the most amazing thing, and i would love to do it one day. 
Another important thing that i would like to mention to other programmers is that, self-learning is the most important, as programmers it is easier to learn on your own rather than having someone spoon feed you.
Because, from my point of view, i learnt far more many things on my own by watching different videos, googling questions and also practicing on my own. Whereas, when i watch my professors lecture im not able to learn that much,
since i can keep up with the professors speed of teaching.
